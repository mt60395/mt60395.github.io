        >Arch Linux Install Guide</a></b></h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux">Arch</a> is a simple and lightweight Linux distribution. 
        It is my daily driver and I don't plan to distrohop 
        for a very long time.<br> I modified the original 
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide" title="Original">Arch installation guide</a> 
        after I personally went through installing it multiple times 
        on multiple machines.

        repository if you are planning to install KDE on Arch.<br>
        The scripts install packages that I use.
